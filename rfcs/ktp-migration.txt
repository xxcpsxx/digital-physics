              Kinetic Trust Protocol (KTP) - Migration Guide

                   Adoption Pathways from Legacy Systems

Abstract

   This document specifies migration patterns for adopting the Kinetic
   Trust Protocol in existing environments. It covers integration with
   legacy authorization systems (OAuth 2.0, SAML, API keys, mTLS),
   progressive deployment strategies, trust bootstrapping, hybrid
   operation during transition, and success metrics.

   The specification acknowledges that no organization will adopt KTP
   through wholesale replacement. Migration must be incremental,
   reversible, and demonstrably valuable at each stage.

Status of This Memo

   This document is a draft specification developed by the New Mexico
   Cyber Intelligence & Threat Response Alliance (NMCITRA). It has not
   been submitted to the IETF and does not represent an Internet
   Standard or consensus of any standards body.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  The Adoption Problem

   The best protocol is worthless if no one can adopt it.

   KTP proposes a fundamentally different approach to authorization:
   physics-based constraints rather than policy enforcement, Trust
   Scores derived from environmental sensors, Silent Veto that cannot
   be overridden. This is a significant departure from OAuth tokens,
   RBAC policies, and API key validation.

   Organizations considering KTP face real barriers:

   - Existing investment in identity infrastructure
   - Integration contracts with vendors and partners
   - Compliance requirements tied to current systems
   - Operational expertise in current tooling
   - Risk of disruption during transition

   No organization will abandon working systems for an unproven
   alternative. Migration must be:

   - Incremental: Value delivered at each stage
   - Reversible: Easy rollback if problems arise
   - Observable: Clear visibility into behavior before enforcement
   - Compatible: Works alongside existing systems during transition

   This document provides the adoption pathway that makes KTP
   practical, not just theoretical.

1.2.  Migration Principles

   Principle 1: Observe Before Enforce

      Never enforce KTP constraints until you have observed their
      impact in your specific environment. Shadow mode lets you see
      what would have happened without affecting production.

   Principle 2: Coexist, Don't Replace

      KTP should run alongside existing authorization during
      transition. Dual-stack operation allows comparison and provides
      fallback. Full replacement comes only after confidence is
      established.

   Principle 3: Earn Trust for the System

      Ironically, KTP itself must earn trust before organizations will
      trust it. Each migration stage builds confidence through
      demonstrated reliability and value.

   Principle 4: Preserve Optionality

      Every stage should be reversible. Design migration so that
      rollback is straightforward and data is preserved regardless
      of direction.

   Principle 5: Start Small, Expand Gradually

      Begin with a single service, a single API, a single team. Prove
      value in a constrained scope before expanding. Island of Blue
      in a sea of Wild.


2.  Terminology

   Advisory Mode:
      A deployment stage where KTP evaluates requests and reports
      recommendations, but legacy authorization makes final decisions.

   Bootstrap Trust:
      Initial Trust Score assigned to existing identities when
      joining KTP, based on historical behavior and role.

   Canary Enforcement:
      Selective enforcement of KTP constraints on a small percentage
      of traffic while the remainder uses legacy authorization.

   Dual-Stack:
      Operating both legacy authorization and KTP simultaneously,
      with configurable priority and fallback.

   Full Enforcement:
      Complete reliance on KTP for authorization decisions, with
      legacy systems retired or relegated to identity provision.

   Green Zone:
      KTP zone type with minimal enforcement, suitable as transition
      boundary between Wild (no KTP) and Blue (full KTP).

   Legacy System:
      Existing authorization infrastructure (OAuth, SAML, API keys,
      etc.) operating before KTP adoption.

   Migration Stage:
      A defined phase in the transition from legacy authorization
      to KTP enforcement, each with specific characteristics and
      success criteria.

   Observation Mode:
      Initial deployment stage focused on collecting telemetry and
      establishing baselines without any KTP evaluation.

   Progressive Enforcement:
      Gradual expansion of KTP enforcement scope (services, actions,
      agents) based on demonstrated success.

   Shadow Mode:
      A deployment stage where KTP evaluates all requests but does
      not affect authorization decisions. Results are logged for
      comparison with legacy system decisions.

   Trust Bridging:
      The process of translating legacy credentials (OAuth tokens,
      SAML assertions) into KTP Trust Proofs during hybrid operation.


3.  Legacy System Integration

3.1.  OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Integration

   OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are the most common authorization
   frameworks for modern applications. KTP can integrate at multiple
   points.

3.1.1.  Token Enrichment

   The simplest integration adds KTP claims to existing OAuth tokens:

   Standard OAuth Token:
      {
        "sub": "user-123",
        "scope": "read write",
        "exp": 1732550400
      }

   KTP-Enriched Token:
      {
        "sub": "user-123",
        "scope": "read write",
        "exp": 1732550400,
        "ktp": {
          "e_base": 72,
          "e_trust": 68,
          "tier": "analyst",
          "trajectory_hash": "sha256:abc...",
          "oracle": "https://oracle.example.com",
          "proof_exp": 1732547000
        }
      }

   Token enrichment preserves OAuth compatibility while adding KTP
   context. Resource servers can:
   - Ignore KTP claims (full backward compatibility)
   - Use KTP claims for additional constraints (hybrid mode)
   - Require KTP claims (forward migration)

3.1.2.  Authorization Server Extension

   The OAuth Authorization Server can be extended to:

   1. Query Trust Oracle during token issuance
   2. Embed Trust Proof in access token
   3. Adjust token lifetime based on Trust Score
   4. Limit scopes based on Trust Tier

   Example flow:

   1. Client requests token with scopes [read, write, admin]
   2. AuthZ Server authenticates user
   3. AuthZ Server queries Trust Oracle for user's Trust Proof
   4. Trust Oracle returns E_trust = 68, tier = analyst
   5. AuthZ Server filters scopes: [read, write] (admin requires operator)
   6. AuthZ Server issues token with KTP claims and filtered scopes

3.1.3.  Resource Server Enforcement

   Resource servers can enforce KTP constraints independently:

   Request arrives with OAuth token:

   1. Validate OAuth token signature and expiration
   2. Extract KTP claims (if present)
   3. If KTP claims present:
      a. Verify Trust Proof signature against known Oracle
      b. Check Trust Proof expiration
      c. Evaluate A <= E_trust for requested action
      d. If KTP denies, return 403 with KTP error
   4. If KTP claims absent:
      a. Evaluate OAuth scopes per legacy logic
      b. Optionally query Trust Oracle for real-time proof

   This approach allows gradual enforcement:
   - Phase 1: Accept requests with or without KTP claims
   - Phase 2: Require KTP claims, use OAuth as fallback
   - Phase 3: Require KTP claims, OAuth for identity only

3.1.4.  OIDC UserInfo Extension

   The OIDC UserInfo endpoint can be extended to provide Trust Score:

   Standard UserInfo Response:
      {
        "sub": "user-123",
        "name": "Alice Smith",
        "email": "alice@example.com"
      }

   KTP-Extended UserInfo Response:
      {
        "sub": "user-123",
        "name": "Alice Smith",
        "email": "alice@example.com",
        "ktp_trust_score": {
          "e_base": 72,
          "e_trust": 68,
          "tier": "analyst",
          "trajectory_url": "https://oracle.example.com/trajectory/user-123",
          "proof_url": "https://oracle.example.com/proof/user-123"
        }
      }


3.2.  SAML 2.0 Integration

   SAML remains common in enterprise environments. KTP integrates
   through attribute extensions.

3.2.1.  Attribute Statement Extension

   SAML Assertions can include KTP attributes:

      <saml:AttributeStatement>
        <saml:Attribute Name="ktp:e_base">
          <saml:AttributeValue>72</saml:AttributeValue>
        </saml:Attribute>
        <saml:Attribute Name="ktp:e_trust">
          <saml:AttributeValue>68</saml:AttributeValue>
        </saml:Attribute>
        <saml:Attribute Name="ktp:tier">
          <saml:AttributeValue>analyst</saml:AttributeValue>
        </saml:Attribute>
        <saml:Attribute Name="ktp:proof">
          <saml:AttributeValue>[base64-encoded Trust Proof]</saml:AttributeValue>
        </saml:Attribute>
      </saml:AttributeStatement>

3.2.2.  Identity Provider Extension

   The SAML IdP can query Trust Oracle during assertion generation:

   1. User authenticates to IdP
   2. IdP queries Trust Oracle for user's current Trust Proof
   3. IdP includes KTP attributes in SAML Assertion
   4. SP receives assertion with embedded Trust Proof
   5. SP validates both SAML signature and KTP Trust Proof

3.2.3.  Service Provider Enforcement

   SPs can enforce KTP constraints on SAML-authenticated sessions:

   1. Validate SAML Assertion per standard SAML processing
   2. Extract KTP attributes from AttributeStatement
   3. Verify embedded Trust Proof against known Oracle
   4. For each request during session:
      a. Evaluate A <= E_trust
      b. Enforce tier-appropriate constraints
   5. Optionally refresh Trust Proof periodically during session


3.3.  API Key Integration

   API keys remain common for service-to-service communication and
   developer access. KTP can enhance API key systems without
   replacing them.

3.3.1.  API Key to Agent Mapping

   Each API key maps to a KTP agent identity:

      {
        "api_key_hash": "sha256:xyz...",
        "agent_id": "agent:service:payment-processor",
        "created": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
        "owner": "team:payments",
        "ktp_binding": {
          "oracle": "https://oracle.example.com",
          "e_base": 65,
          "lineage": "tethered",
          "sponsor": "agent:persistent:payments-team-lead"
        }
      }

   When a request arrives with an API key:
   1. Validate API key exists and is active
   2. Look up associated agent_id
   3. Query Trust Oracle for current Trust Proof
   4. Evaluate request against Trust Score

3.3.2.  Key-Embedded Trust Proofs

   For reduced latency, Trust Proofs can be embedded in enhanced
   API key format:

   Traditional API key:
      X-API-Key: abc123xyz

   KTP-enhanced header:
      X-API-Key: abc123xyz
      X-KTP-Proof: eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIs... [JWT Trust Proof]

   Or combined format:
      X-API-Key: abc123xyz.eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIs...

   The client is responsible for refreshing the Trust Proof component
   before expiration.

3.3.3.  Tiered API Keys

   API keys can be issued with tier constraints:

      {
        "api_key_hash": "sha256:xyz...",
        "agent_id": "agent:service:readonly-analytics",
        "tier_cap": "observer",
        "allowed_actions": ["read_public", "read_internal"],
        "max_action_risk": 30
      }

   Even if the agent's Trust Score would permit higher capabilities,
   the key itself constrains what can be done. This allows:
   - Production keys with full capability
   - Staging keys with reduced capability
   - Read-only keys for analytics
   - Emergency keys with minimal access


3.4.  Mutual TLS (mTLS) Integration

   mTLS provides strong cryptographic identity for services. KTP
   complements mTLS with dynamic trust.

3.4.1.  Certificate to Agent Mapping

   X.509 certificates map to KTP agent identities:

      {
        "certificate_fingerprint": "sha256:abc...",
        "subject_dn": "CN=payment-service,O=Example,C=US",
        "agent_id": "agent:service:payment-processor",
        "ktp_binding": {
          "oracle": "https://oracle.example.com",
          "e_base": 85,
          "lineage": "persistent"
        }
      }

   Certificate identity establishes WHO; KTP establishes WHAT they
   can do right now.

3.4.2.  TLS Extension for Trust Proof

   A TLS extension can carry Trust Proof during handshake:

   Extension Type: ktp_trust_proof (TBD by IANA)
   Extension Data: Serialized Trust Proof

   This allows trust evaluation at connection establishment, before
   any application data is exchanged.

3.4.3.  Post-Handshake Trust Updates

   For long-lived connections, Trust Proofs can be updated via:

   1. Application-layer refresh (HTTP header on each request)
   2. TLS post-handshake authentication with new proof
   3. Periodic trust channel messages (WebSocket, gRPC stream)


3.5.  Service Mesh Identity (SPIFFE/SPIRE)

   SPIFFE provides service identity in cloud-native environments.
   KTP integrates naturally with SPIFFE identities.

3.5.1.  SPIFFE ID to Agent Mapping

   SPIFFE IDs map directly to KTP agent identities:

   SPIFFE ID:
      spiffe://example.com/service/payment-processor

   KTP Agent ID:
      agent:spiffe:example.com:service:payment-processor

   The mapping is deterministic, requiring no separate registry.

3.5.2.  SVID Enhancement

   SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents (SVIDs) can include KTP
   claims in the x509-svid or jwt-svid:

   JWT-SVID with KTP claims:
      {
        "sub": "spiffe://example.com/service/payment-processor",
        "aud": ["spiffe://example.com/service/api-gateway"],
        "exp": 1732550400,
        "ktp": {
          "e_base": 85,
          "e_trust": 78,
          "tier": "operator",
          "proof_sig": "sig:oracle:abc..."
        }
      }

3.5.3.  Trust Oracle as SPIRE Plugin

   SPIRE can be extended with a Trust Oracle plugin:

   1. Workload requests SVID from SPIRE Agent
   2. SPIRE Agent attests workload identity
   3. SPIRE Agent queries Trust Oracle plugin
   4. Trust Oracle returns current Trust Proof for workload
   5. SPIRE Agent issues SVID with embedded KTP claims
   6. Workload presents enhanced SVID to peers

   This integrates KTP into existing SPIFFE/SPIRE deployments with
   minimal architectural change.

4.1.2.  Agent Discovery

   Identify all entities that will become KTP agents:

   - Service accounts
   - API clients
   - Human users (via SSO)
   - Automated jobs
   - Third-party integrations

   For each, capture:
   - Current authorization method
   - Typical action patterns
   - Peak usage times
   - Historical incidents

   Legacy authorization remains authoritative. KTP evaluates but
   does not affect the request. Discrepancies are logged.

4.2.2.  Discrepancy Analysis

   For each request, log:

      {
        "timestamp": "2025-11-25T14:30:00Z",
        "request_id": "req-abc-123",
        "agent": "service:payment-processor",
        "action": "write_transaction",
        "legacy_decision": "allow",
        "legacy_reason": "scope:write present",
        "ktp_decision": "deny",
        "ktp_reason": "A(65) > E_trust(58)",
        "ktp_context": {
          "e_base": 72,
          "e_trust": 58,
          "risk_factor": 0.19,
          "action_risk": 65,
          "tier": "analyst",
          "tier_max_risk": 60
        },
        "discrepancy": true,
        "discrepancy_type": "legacy_allow_ktp_deny"
      }

   Aggregate discrepancies by:
   - Agent (which agents are most affected?)
   - Action (which actions are most contentious?)
   - Time (are there temporal patterns?)
   - Environmental state (high-risk times?)


4.3.  Stage 2: Advisory Mode

   Purpose: Present KTP recommendations to operators without
   automatic enforcement.

   Duration: 2-4 weeks

   Activities:
   - Surface KTP recommendations in admin UI
   - Alert on high-risk requests that KTP would deny
   - Allow operators to manually apply KTP constraints
   - Gather operator feedback on recommendations

   Deliverables:
   - Operator feedback report
   - Recommendation accuracy assessment
   - UI/UX refinements
   - Enforcement readiness assessment

   Success Criteria:
   - Operators find recommendations useful
   - > 80% of KTP denials validated by operators
   - < 10% of recommendations overridden
   - Operators comfortable with enforcement

4.3.1.  Advisory Dashboard

   The advisory dashboard shows:

   - Current environmental state (Context Tensor)
   - Agent Trust Scores (real-time)
   - Recent KTP recommendations
   - Discrepancy trend (improving?)
   - Projected enforcement impact

   Operators can:
   - Acknowledge recommendations
   - Override with justification (logged)
   - Adjust Trust Scores (within bounds)
   - Tune action risk classifications

4.3.2.  Alert Integration

   Advisory mode integrates with existing alerting:

   - PagerDuty: High-risk requests KTP would deny
   - Slack: Summary of recommendations
   - SIEM: All KTP evaluations for correlation
   - Dashboard: Real-time Trust Score display


4.4.  Stage 3: Canary Enforcement

   Purpose: Enforce KTP on small percentage of traffic.

   Duration: 2-4 weeks per increment

   Activities:
   - Enable KTP enforcement for 1% of traffic
   - Monitor for unexpected denials
   - Compare business metrics (latency, errors, conversions)
   - Gradually increase percentage

   Deliverables:
   - Canary performance report
   - Business metric comparison
   - Incident log (if any)
   - Expansion readiness assessment

   Success Criteria:
   - No unexpected outages
   - Business metrics within tolerance
   - Denial rate matches shadow predictions
   - Team confidence for expansion

4.4.1.  Canary Selection

   Canary traffic can be selected by:

   - Random sampling (1%, 5%, 10%, etc.)
   - Specific agents (start with lowest risk)
   - Specific actions (start with read-only)
   - Specific time windows (off-peak first)
   - Specific user segments (internal first)

   Recommended progression:
   1. 1% random, read-only actions
   2. 5% random, read-only actions
   3. 10% random, all actions
   4. 25% random, all actions
   5. 50% random, all actions
   6. Stage 4 (progressive by service)

4.4.2.  Canary Metrics

   Monitor during canary:

   - Request success rate (KTP vs legacy cohort)
   - P50/P95/P99 latency (KTP overhead)
   - Denial rate (expected vs actual)
   - False positive reports (user complaints)
   - Business conversion (if applicable)


4.5.  Stage 4: Progressive Enforcement

   Purpose: Expand KTP enforcement service by service.

   Duration: 1-2 weeks per service

   Activities:
   - Enable full KTP enforcement for one service
   - Monitor and validate
   - Move to next service
   - Repeat until all services covered

   Deliverables:
   - Per-service enforcement report
   - Cross-service dependency validation
   - Full coverage timeline
   - Legacy deprecation plan

   Success Criteria:
   - Each service stable under KTP enforcement
   - Cross-service calls function correctly
   - No rollbacks required
   - Team operating confidently

4.5.1.  Service Ordering

   Order services for progressive enforcement by:

   1. Dependency depth (leaves first, then parents)
   2. Risk level (low-risk first)
   3. Traffic volume (low-traffic first for learning)
   4. Team readiness (willing teams first)

   Example ordering:
   - Week 1: Internal tools, documentation services
   - Week 2: Analytics, reporting services
   - Week 3: Customer-facing read APIs
   - Week 4: Customer-facing write APIs
   - Week 5: Payment processing
   - Week 6: Core platform services

4.5.2.  Boundary Management

   During progressive enforcement, manage boundaries between:

   - KTP-enforced services (Blue)
   - Legacy-authorized services (Wild)

   Cross-boundary calls:
   - Blue → Wild: Include Trust Proof (Wild may ignore)
   - Wild → Blue: Require Trust Proof or bridge

   Trust bridging at boundary:
   - Wild service presents OAuth token
   - Gateway validates OAuth, queries Trust Oracle
   - Gateway issues Trust Proof based on OAuth identity
   - Request proceeds with bridged Trust Proof


4.6.  Stage 5: Full Enforcement

   Purpose: Complete KTP enforcement across all services.

   Duration: Ongoing

   Activities:
   - Retire legacy authorization for covered services
   - Operate Trust Oracle as authoritative
   - Full Flight Recorder logging
   - Continuous tuning and improvement

   Deliverables:
   - Legacy deprecation complete
   - Full KTP operational runbook
   - Incident response procedures
   - Ongoing metrics and reporting

   Success Criteria:
   - All services under KTP enforcement
   - Legacy authorization retired or identity-only
   - Operational stability demonstrated
   - Team fully trained and confident

4.6.1.  Legacy Retirement

   After full enforcement, legacy systems can be:

   - Retired completely (ideal for API keys)
   - Reduced to identity-only (OAuth for authn, KTP for authz)
   - Maintained as emergency fallback (temporary)

   Do NOT maintain parallel authorization long-term. This creates:
   - Confusion about authoritative source
   - Maintenance burden
   - Potential bypass vectors
   - Inconsistent audit trail


5.  Trust Bootstrapping

   New agents entering KTP need initial Trust Scores. For migration,
   existing identities need bootstrap trust based on historical
   behavior.

5.1.  Initial Trust Assignment

   Bootstrap trust is assigned based on:

   1. Role category
   2. Historical behavior (if available)
   3. Sponsorship relationship
   4. Service criticality

5.1.1.  Role-Based Bootstrap

   Default initial E_base by role category:

   +----------------------+---------+------------+
   | Role Category        | E_base  | Tier       |
   +----------------------+---------+------------+
   | Infrastructure/Admin | 70      | Analyst    |
   | Production Service   | 60      | Analyst    |
   | Internal Tool        | 50      | Observer   |
   | External Integration | 40      | Observer   |
   | New/Unknown          | 30      | Observer   |
   | Probationary         | 20      | Hibernation|
   +----------------------+---------+------------+

   These are starting points. Trust increases through demonstrated
   reliable operation.

5.1.2.  Behavioral Import

   For identities with historical data, adjust bootstrap based on:

   - Incident history (reduce for past issues)
   - Operational tenure (increase for long stable operation)
   - Access patterns (increase for consistent patterns)
   - Compliance record (increase for clean audits)

   Example adjustment:

      base_bootstrap = 60 (production service)
      tenure_bonus = +5 (3+ years stable operation)
      incident_penalty = -10 (major incident in past year)
      compliance_bonus = +3 (clean SOC 2 audit)
      
      final_bootstrap = 60 + 5 - 10 + 3 = 58

5.2.  Historical Behavior Import

   If historical logs are available, construct synthetic trajectory:

   1. Extract access events from legacy logs
   2. Classify each event by action risk
   3. Identify any incidents or anomalies
   4. Calculate what Trust Score would have been
   5. Use terminal value as bootstrap E_base

   This gives agents "credit" for historical good behavior.

5.2.1.  Log Sources for Import

   - SIEM logs (authentication, authorization events)
   - Application logs (API calls, database queries)
   - Cloud provider logs (AWS CloudTrail, GCP Audit)
   - Network logs (flow data, firewall events)
   - Incident management (PagerDuty, ServiceNow)

5.2.2.  Import Limitations

   Historical import has limits:

   - Cannot reconstruct environmental context (R unknown)
   - Action risk classification may differ from current
   - Legacy systems may not log all relevant events
   - Time window affects reliability (recent > old)

   Treat imported history as approximation, not truth.

5.3.  Sponsorship Chains

   For agents without sufficient history, sponsorship provides
   bootstrap trust:

   1. Established agent sponsors new agent
   2. Sponsor stakes portion of their own trust
   3. New agent receives bootstrap from sponsor
   4. New agent operates as Tethered until sufficient history

   Sponsorship during migration:
   - Infrastructure team sponsors production services
   - Service owners sponsor their integrations
   - Security team sponsors security tooling
   - No agent bootstraps without sponsor


6.  Hybrid Operation

6.1.  Dual-Stack Authorization

   During migration, both systems operate simultaneously:

   Request evaluation:
   1. Legacy system evaluates (OAuth scope, RBAC policy, etc.)
   2. KTP evaluates (A <= E_trust, tier constraints)
   3. Final decision based on configuration:
      - "legacy_primary": Legacy decides, KTP logged
      - "ktp_primary": KTP decides, legacy fallback
      - "unanimous": Both must allow
      - "either": Either allowing is sufficient

   Recommended progression:
   - Stage 1-2: legacy_primary
   - Stage 3: unanimous (most restrictive, safest)
   - Stage 4: ktp_primary
   - Stage 5: KTP only

6.2.  Boundary Enforcement

   During migration, clear boundaries define where KTP is enforced:

   - KTP Zone: Full KTP enforcement (Blue/Cyan)
   - Legacy Zone: Legacy authorization only (Wild)
   - Boundary Zone: Dual-stack, trust bridging (Green)

   Boundary PEPs handle translation:

      ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
      │    KTP Zone     │    │   Legacy Zone   │
      │                 │    │                 │
      │  ┌───────────┐  │    │  ┌───────────┐  │
      │  │ Service A │◄─┼────┼──│ Service X │  │
      │  └───────────┘  │    │  └───────────┘  │
      │       │         │    │       │         │
      │       ▼         │    │       ▼         │
      │  ┌───────────┐  │    │  ┌───────────┐  │
      │  │ Service B │──┼────┼─►│ Service Y │  │
      │  └───────────┘  │    │  └───────────┘  │
      │                 │    │                 │
      └────────┬────────┘    └────────┬────────┘
               │                      │
               └──────────┬───────────┘
                          │
                  ┌───────▼───────┐
                  │ Boundary PEP  │
                  │ (Trust Bridge)│
                  └───────────────┘

6.3.  Gradual Perimeter Expansion

   Expand KTP enforcement perimeter gradually:

   Phase 1: Single service island
      - One service fully KTP-enforced
      - All dependencies via boundary PEP
      - Prove concept, build confidence

   Phase 2: Service cluster
      - Group of related services under KTP
      - Internal calls KTP-native
      - External calls via boundary

   Phase 3: Domain coverage
      - Entire domain (payments, users, etc.) under KTP
      - Cross-domain calls via boundary
      - Boundary shrinks as coverage expands

   Phase 4: Full coverage
      - All services under KTP
      - Boundary only at external edge
      - Legacy retired internally


7.  Rollback Procedures

7.1.  Stage Regression

   If problems arise, regress to previous stage:

   - Stage 5 → 4: Re-enable legacy for problematic services
   - Stage 4 → 3: Reduce to canary percentage
   - Stage 3 → 2: Disable enforcement, advisory only
   - Stage 2 → 1: Disable recommendations, shadow only
   - Stage 1 → 0: Disable KTP evaluation entirely

   Rollback should be:
   - Pre-planned (runbook ready)
   - Fast (< 5 minutes to execute)
   - Safe (no data loss)
   - Reversible (can re-advance when ready)

7.2.  Emergency Fallback

   For critical incidents:

   1. Disable KTP enforcement at gateway (single config change)
   2. All requests fall back to legacy authorization
   3. KTP continues logging (shadow mode) for analysis
   4. Investigate root cause
   5. Fix and re-enable

   Emergency fallback configuration:

      {
        "enforcement_mode": "emergency_fallback",
        "legacy_authoritative": true,
        "ktp_evaluation": "shadow",
        "alert": "security-team",
        "auto_restore_after": null,
        "requires_manual_restore": true
      }

7.3.  Data Preservation

   During rollback, preserve:

   - Trust Scores (don't reset agent progress)
   - Trajectory chains (maintain history)
   - Flight Recorder logs (audit continuity)
   - Configuration (restore point)

   Rollback affects enforcement, not data. When re-advancing, agents
   retain earned trust.


8.  Success Metrics

   Track these metrics throughout migration:

8.1.  Adoption Metrics

   - Sensor coverage (% of environment instrumented)
   - Agent coverage (% of identities with Trust Scores)
   - Request coverage (% of requests KTP-evaluated)
   - Enforcement coverage (% of requests KTP-enforced)

8.2.  Accuracy Metrics

   - False positive rate (KTP denied, should have allowed)
   - False negative rate (KTP allowed, should have denied)
   - Discrepancy rate (KTP differs from legacy)
   - Override rate (operators overriding KTP)

8.3.  Performance Metrics

   - Evaluation latency (KTP overhead per request)
   - Oracle response time (Trust Proof generation)
   - PEP throughput (requests per second)
   - System availability (Oracle, PEP uptime)

8.4.  Security Metrics

   - Incidents prevented (Silent Veto in action)
   - Time to detect (anomaly identification)
   - Blast radius reduction (compared to legacy)
   - Audit completeness (Flight Recorder coverage)

8.5.  Business Metrics

   - Request latency (user-facing impact)
   - Error rate (failed requests)
   - Conversion rate (if applicable)
   - Operational cost (compared to legacy)


9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Migration-Specific Risks

   Dual-Stack Bypass:
      Attackers may target the weaker of two systems during
      hybrid operation. Ensure legacy system remains hardened.

   Trust Bootstrap Manipulation:
      Attackers may attempt to manipulate historical data to
      inflate bootstrap Trust Scores. Verify import sources.

   Boundary Exploitation:
      Attackers may exploit trust bridging at zone boundaries.
      Apply principle of least privilege at boundaries.

   Rollback Exploitation:
      Attackers may trigger conditions that cause rollback,
      then exploit legacy weaknesses. Monitor for patterns.

9.2.  Mitigations

   - Maintain legacy security posture during migration
   - Verify historical data integrity before import
   - Apply KTP constraints at boundaries even during bridging
   - Require approval for rollback, investigate triggers
   - Monitor for migration-aware attack patterns
