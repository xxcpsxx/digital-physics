           Kinetic Trust Protocol (KTP) - Threat Model Specification

Abstract

   This document specifies the formal threat model for the Kinetic
   Trust Protocol (KTP). It identifies assets, threat actors, attack
   vectors, and mitigations across all KTP components.

   The specification uses the STRIDE methodology to analyze threats
   systematically and maps each threat to specific KTP mitigations
   documented in companion specifications.

Status of This Memo

   This document is a draft specification developed by the New Mexico
   Cyber Intelligence & Threat Response Alliance (NMCITRA). It has not
   been submitted to the IETF and does not represent an Internet
   Standard or consensus of any standards body.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Purpose

   This threat model serves three purposes:

   1. IDENTIFY risks before deployment, not after incident
   2. DOCUMENT security rationale for design decisions
   3. GUIDE implementers toward secure implementations

   Every security system has failure modes. This document makes
   KTP's failure modes explicit.

1.2.  Scope

   This threat model covers:

   - All components defined in KTP specifications
   - All communication paths between components
   - All stored data and state
   - All cryptographic operations

   This threat model does NOT cover:

   - Threats to systems protected BY KTP (that's the application's threat model)
   - Physical security of data centers
   - Human factors beyond insider threat
   - Legal and compliance risks (see KTP-PROBLEMS)

1.3.  Methodology

   This document uses:

   STRIDE: Systematic threat categorization
   - Spoofing (authentication)
   - Tampering (integrity)
   - Repudiation (non-repudiation)
   - Information Disclosure (confidentiality)
   - Denial of Service (availability)
   - Elevation of Privilege (authorization)

   ATTACK TREES: Hierarchical threat decomposition

   DREAD: Risk scoring (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability,
   Affected Users, Discoverability)

   Each threat includes:
   - ID: Unique identifier (TM-STRIDE-NNN)
   - Description: What the threat is
   - Attack Vector: How attacker achieves it
   - Preconditions: What must be true for attack
   - Impact: Consequences if successful
   - Likelihood: Probability assessment
   - Mitigations: How KTP addresses it
   - Residual Risk: What remains after mitigation
   - References: Related KTP specifications

8.  Risk Assessment

8.1.  Risk Matrix

   Impact scale:
   - CRITICAL: System-wide compromise, data breach
   - HIGH: Zone-wide impact, significant breach
   - MEDIUM: Limited impact, partial compromise
   - LOW: Minimal impact, quickly recoverable

   Likelihood scale:
   - HIGH: Likely to occur annually
   - MEDIUM: May occur over system lifetime
   - LOW: Unlikely but possible
   - VERY LOW: Requires exceptional circumstances

   Risk = Impact × Likelihood

   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                    |        Impact                                |
   | Likelihood         | CRITICAL | HIGH   | MEDIUM | LOW            |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | HIGH               | CRITICAL | HIGH   | MEDIUM | LOW            |
   | MEDIUM             | HIGH     | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | LOW            |
   | LOW                | MEDIUM   | MEDIUM | LOW    | LOW            |
   | VERY LOW           | MEDIUM   | LOW    | LOW    | VERY LOW       |

   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

8.2.  Residual Risks

   Risks that remain after all mitigations:

8.2.1.  Nation-State Attacks

   Description: Well-resourced state actor with advanced capabilities
   
   Residual because:
   - Effectively unlimited resources
   - Zero-day capabilities
   - Supply chain access
   - Insider recruitment
   
   Acceptance: KTP increases attack cost significantly. Perfect
   defense against nation-states is not achievable. Focus on
   detection and limiting blast radius.

8.2.2.  Insider with Physical Access

   Description: Malicious insider with physical access to HSMs
   
   Residual because:
   - Physical access bypasses many controls
   - HSM side-channels exist
   - Multi-person controls help but don't eliminate
   
   Acceptance: Multi-person access, geographic distribution,
   and audit provide defense in depth. Some residual risk accepted.

8.2.3.  Novel Cryptographic Attacks

   Description: Future attack on current cryptographic algorithms
   
   Residual because:
   - Cryptography may be broken in future
   - Quantum computers may emerge faster than expected
   
   Acceptance: Cryptographic agility allows transition. Hybrid
   signatures provide hedge. Monitor cryptographic developments.

8.2.4.  Coordinated Multi-Vector Attack

   Description: Simultaneous attack on multiple components
   
   Residual because:
   - Mitigations assume sequential attacks
   - Coordinated attack may overwhelm response
   
   Acceptance: Defense in depth limits damage. Each component
   fails independently. Monitoring enables detection.

8.2.5.  Long-Term Baseline Manipulation

   Description: Patient attacker slowly poisons baselines
   
   Residual because:
   - Drift detection has limits
   - Very slow changes may evade detection
   
   Acceptance: External anchors, cross-zone correlation, and
   periodic rebaselining from known-good states limit exposure.


9.  Security Requirements

   Based on threat analysis, implementations MUST meet these
   security requirements:

   SR-001: Cryptographic Signatures
   All Trust Proofs MUST be cryptographically signed per KTP-CRYPTO.
   Rationale: Prevents forgery (TM-T-001)

   SR-002: Threshold Signing
   Level 2+ MUST use threshold signatures for Trust Proofs.
   Rationale: Prevents single-point compromise (TM-S-002)

   SR-003: Transport Security
   All communication MUST use TLS 1.3.
   Rationale: Prevents interception (TM-I-*)

   SR-004: Sensor Authentication
   All sensors MUST authenticate to aggregators.
   Rationale: Prevents spoofing (TM-SEN-001)

   SR-005: Sensor Diversity
   Each Context Tensor dimension SHOULD have multiple sensor types.
   Rationale: Limits single-sensor compromise impact

   SR-006: Outlier Detection
   Sensor aggregation MUST implement outlier detection.
   Rationale: Detects sensor spoofing

   SR-007: Baseline Drift Detection
   Implementations MUST detect baseline drift.
   Rationale: Prevents baseline poisoning (TM-SEN-003)

   SR-008: Flight Recorder Integrity
   Flight Recorder MUST use cryptographic chaining.
   Rationale: Prevents tampering (TM-FR-002)

   SR-009: Append-Only Audit
   Flight Recorder MUST be append-only.
   Rationale: Prevents deletion (TM-FR-001)

   SR-010: No Override Mechanism
   Implementations MUST NOT include override for Zeroth Law.
   Rationale: Prevents privilege escalation (TM-E-003)

   SR-011: Administrator Trust Scores
   Administrators MUST have Trust Scores and be subject to A ≤ E.
   Rationale: Limits insider abuse (TM-E-003)

   SR-012: Short Proof Lifetime
   Trust Proofs MUST expire within 60 seconds.
   Rationale: Limits replay window (TM-S-001)

   SR-013: Rate Limiting
   All endpoints MUST implement rate limiting.
   Rationale: Limits DoS impact (TM-D-*)

   SR-014: Fail-Safe Mode
   Loss of Oracle MUST result in fail-safe (deny uncertain).
   Rationale: Security not degraded by availability attack

   SR-015: Soul Immutability
   Soul constraints MUST NOT be modifiable through normal config.
   Rationale: Prevents sovereignty bypass (TM-E-004)

   - HSMs protect keys from extraction

   If violated: Fundamental security properties fail

10.2.  Operational Assumptions

   - HSMs are operated according to vendor guidelines
   - Key ceremonies are conducted correctly
   - Administrators follow security procedures
   - Monitoring is reviewed and actioned

   If violated: Mitigations may not be effective

10.3.  Infrastructure Assumptions

   - Network segmentation is correctly implemented
   - Time sources are reasonably accurate
   - Hardware is not compromised at manufacture
   - Physical security of data centers is adequate

   If violated: Multiple threats become more likely

10.4.  Dependencies

   External dependencies that affect security:

   - HSM vendor security
   - TLS library security
   - Operating system security
   - Cloud provider security (if applicable)
   - PKI infrastructure
   - Time synchronization infrastructure

   Each dependency is a potential attack surface.
