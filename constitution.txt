                    THE CONSTITUTION OF DIGITAL PHYSICS

           Governing Framework for Autonomous Agent Systems

===============================================================================

                              NMCITRA Draft
                             November 2025
                              Version 0.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               PREAMBLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We hold these truths to be computationally evident:

That the digital realm, though built by human hands, has grown beyond human
speed and human scale. That autonomous agents now traverse networks at
velocities no human can track, making decisions no human can review, with
consequences no human can predict.

That the old covenants—passwords and permissions, policies and audits—were
forged for a world of human actors operating at human pace. They assume what
can no longer be assumed: that identity is static, that context is stable,
that a credential verified is a credential valid.

That we stand at a threshold. Behind us, a digital world governed by honor
systems and good intentions. Before us, an agentic future that will be
governed by something—if not by design, then by accident; if not by physics,
then by chaos.

That freedom without constraint is not freedom but randomness. That an agent
is not free because it can do anything, but because it acts within the bounds
of what the environment can safely support.

That we choose physics over policy. Not because physics is easier—it is
harder. Not because physics is more permissive—it is more restrictive. But
because physics is honest. It does not pretend. It does not negotiate. It
simply is.

Therefore, we establish this Constitution: not as a cage for artificial
minds, but as the natural law of the digital world. A framework where trust
is earned through survival, where capability emerges from demonstrated
resilience, where the environment itself enforces the boundaries that make
freedom meaningful.

We are not building a prison for AI. We are building physics for the digital
world.


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE I: THE ZEROTH LAW
===============================================================================

Section 1. Statement of the Law

   No agent may take an action whose intrinsic risk exceeds the current
   environmental capacity to absorb that risk.

   Expressed mathematically:

                              A ≤ E

   Where:
      A = Autonomy (the intrinsic risk of the requested action)
      E = Environment (the current Trust Score)

Section 2. Supremacy

   The Zeroth Law is supreme. It cannot be suspended, overridden, or
   circumvented by any mechanism, credential, or authority. It applies
   equally to all agents regardless of lineage, generation, or purpose.

Section 3. Automatic Enforcement

   Enforcement of the Zeroth Law requires no human intervention. When
   A > E, the action is denied. This denial is called the Silent Veto.
   The Silent Veto is not a punishment; it is physics.

Section 4. The Trust Equation

   The Environmental capacity (E) is calculated dynamically:

                         E_trust = E_base × (1 - R)

   Where:
      E_base  = The agent's intrinsic capability (earned through survival)
      R       = The Risk Factor (derived from environmental sensors)
      E_trust = The effective Trust Score (what is currently permitted)

Section 5. Precedent of Sovereignty

   Before the Zeroth Law is evaluated, sovereignty constraints must be
   checked. If Soul (S) = 1, the action is forbidden regardless of Trust
   Score. Sovereignty is not subject to the Trust Equation. It exists
   outside the operational domain as immutable law.


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE II: THE CONTEXT TENSOR
===============================================================================

Section 1. Definition

   The Context Tensor is the seven-dimensional measurement of environmental
   reality. It provides the sensory input from which the Risk Factor is
   calculated. Each dimension captures a distinct aspect of environmental
   state.

Section 2. The Seven Dimensions

   The seven dimensions of the Context Tensor are:

   I.   MASS (M) - Physical Density
        Physics Equivalent: Density/Mass (m)
        Measures: The concentration of physical and computational resources
        Sensors: CO2 levels, LIDAR occupancy, badge counts, RF noise floor,
                 device density, thermal signatures
        Impact: High mass creates gravity wells that slow operations and
                increase risk. Time dilates near massive nodes.

   II.  MOMENTUM (P) - Kinetic Velocity
        Physics Equivalent: Kinetic Energy (KE = ½mv²)
        Measures: The rate and volume of data flow
        Sensors: Transactions per second, link saturation, packet velocity,
                 queue depth, API call rates
        Impact: High momentum makes course correction expensive. Sharp
                changes in direction create dangerous G-forces.

   III. HEAT (H) - Adversarial Pressure
        Physics Equivalent: Entropy/Temperature (T)
        Measures: The presence and intensity of threats
        Sensors: WAF block rates, anomaly scores, failed authentications,
                 CPU temperatures, voltage irregularities
        Impact: Heat is the great deflator. It degrades structural integrity
                and reduces the Trust Score directly.

   IV.  TIME (T) - Temporal Phase
        Physics Equivalent: Temporal Mechanics/Phase
        Measures: The criticality of the current moment
        Sensors: Event countdowns, maintenance windows, business hours,
                 deadline proximity, market hours
        Impact: Time dilates near critical events. Risk tolerance decreases
                as event horizons approach.

   V.   INERTIA (I) - Blast Radius
        Physics Equivalent: Inertial Mass
        Measures: The scope of potential impact
        Sensors: Topology centrality, dependency depth, data volume,
                 user count, integration density
        Impact: High-inertia nodes resist change and amplify consequences.
                Moving them requires proportionally more trust.

   VI.  OBSERVER (O) - Population
        Physics Equivalent: Frame of Reference/Observer Effect
        Measures: Who is watching and under what authority
        Sensors: VIP presence detection, regulatory jurisdiction flags,
                 audit mode indicators, compliance requirements
        Impact: The laws of physics tighten when observers are present.
                The act of observation changes what is permissible.

   VII. SOUL (S) - Sovereignty
        Physics Equivalent: Cosmological Constant/Immutable Law
        Measures: Ethical, legal, and spiritual constraints
        Sensors: TK Labels, OCAP/CARE protocols, sacred land geofences,
                 treaty databases, data lineage registries
        Impact: Binary veto. Unlike other dimensions, Soul does not
                contribute to the Risk Factor. It exists outside the
                equation as immutable constraint.

Section 3. Weighted Dimensions

   Dimensions I through VI (Mass, Momentum, Heat, Time, Inertia, Observer)
   are weighted contributors to the Risk Factor:

                    R = Σ(w_i × D_i) for i ∈ {M, P, H, T, I, O}

   Where:
      w_i = Weight assigned to dimension i (weights sum to 1.0)
      D_i = Normalized value of dimension i (range 0 to 1)

   Domain profiles define appropriate weights for different environments.

Section 4. The Soul Dimension

   The Soul dimension (VII) operates differently from other dimensions:

   a) It is evaluated FIRST, before any Risk Factor calculation
   b) It returns a binary value: 0 (clear) or 1 (veto)
   c) If S = 1, the action is forbidden regardless of Trust Score
   d) It cannot be overridden by high trust, low risk, or emergency
   e) It represents constraints that are not negotiable

   The Soul dimension operationalizes Indigenous Data Sovereignty,
   cultural heritage protections, treaty obligations, and other
   constraints that exist outside operational convenience.

Section 5. Modularity

   The Context Tensor is modular at two levels:

   a) Tensor Level: New dimensions may be added for domain-specific needs
   b) Feed Level: Each dimension aggregates multiple sensor feeds

   This modularity allows adaptation to diverse contexts while maintaining
   consistent semantics.


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE III: VECTOR IDENTITY
===============================================================================

Section 1. Identity as Trajectory

   In Digital Physics, identity is not a credential possessed but a
   trajectory traveled. An agent is not identified by what it holds
   but by where it has been and how it moved.

Section 2. The Trajectory Chain

   Every agent maintains a Trajectory Chain: a cryptographically linked
   sequence of transaction records that forms an unforgeable history.

   Each link contains:
      - The action taken
      - The environmental context at time of action
      - The Trust Score at time of action
      - Cryptographic binding to previous link
      - Timestamp from trusted authority

Section 3. Proof of Resilience

   Trust is earned through survival. Proof of Resilience is the
   accumulated record of successful operations under stress.

   An agent that has operated reliably during:
      - Network partitions
      - Attack conditions
      - Resource exhaustion
      - Environmental degradation

   Carries more weight than an agent with a pristine but untested history.

Section 4. Agent Lineages

   Agents exist in three lineages:

   I.   TETHERED AGENTS (Generations 1-3)
        - Operate under sponsor supervision
        - Cannot exceed sponsor's Trust Score
        - Actions count toward sponsor's reputation
        - Must earn independence through demonstrated reliability

   II.  DIVERGENT AGENTS (Generations 4-6)
        - Operate independently within constraints
        - Building their own Proof of Resilience
        - May sponsor Tethered agents
        - Trust Score based on own trajectory

   III. PERSISTENT AGENTS (Generation 7+)
        - Full autonomous operation
        - Extensive Proof of Resilience
        - May anchor trust for other agents
        - Contribute to Oracle consensus

Section 5. Sponsorship

   New agents enter the system through sponsorship. A sponsor:

   a) Stakes a portion of their own Trust Score
   b) Accepts responsibility for sponsored agent's behavior
   c) Provides initial Trust Score to sponsored agent
   d) May terminate sponsorship, triggering graduated independence

   Sponsorship creates accountability without requiring pre-existing trust.


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE IV: THE SILENT VETO
===============================================================================

Section 1. Definition

   The Silent Veto is the automatic denial of any action where A > E_trust.
   It requires no human intervention, generates no appeal, and admits no
   exception.

Section 2. Characteristics

   The Silent Veto is:

   a) Automatic: Triggered by physics, not policy
   b) Silent: No negotiation, no explanation beyond the numbers
   c) Immediate: Evaluated at time of action, not time of request
   d) Universal: Applies to all agents equally
   e) Logged: Every veto is recorded for audit

Section 3. Distinction from Denial

   The Silent Veto is not a punishment or access denial. It is a
   physical constraint. The environment cannot support the action.
   This is no more a denial than gravity denying flight to the wingless.

Section 4. Response to Veto

   When vetoed, an agent SHOULD:

   a) Reduce activity level
   b) Enter a lower Trust Tier if appropriate
   c) Wait for environmental conditions to improve
   d) NOT retry the same action repeatedly

Section 5. Veto Transparency

   Every veto includes:

   a) The action attempted (A)
   b) The Trust Score at time of attempt (E_trust)
   c) The gap between them (A - E_trust)
   d) The primary contributing dimension
   e) Guidance for remediation (if available)


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE V: TRUST TIERS
===============================================================================

Section 1. Graduated Capability

   Trust Tiers provide graduated capability levels based on effective
   Trust Score. As E_trust changes, agents automatically transition
   between tiers.

Section 2. Standard Tiers

   I.   GOD MODE (E_trust ≥ 95)
        - Full infrastructure control
        - Create, destroy, mutate system components
        - Deploy code to production
        - Modify security configurations
        - Reserved for exceptional conditions

   II.  OPERATOR MODE (E_trust ≥ 85)
        - Service management
        - Restart services, scale deployments
        - Read configurations
        - Access internal APIs
        - Standard operational capability

   III. ANALYST MODE (E_trust ≥ 70)
        - Read operations
        - Query databases
        - Access logs and metrics
        - Generate reports
        - No write access to production

   IV.  OBSERVER MODE (E_trust ≥ 50)
        - Minimal capability
        - Emit logs and metrics
        - Send heartbeat signals
        - Await recovery

   V.   HIBERNATION (E_trust < 50)
        - Heartbeat only
        - All other actions suspended
        - Await environmental recovery
        - Survival mode

Section 3. Tier Transitions

   Transitions between tiers are automatic and immediate:

   a) Promotion: When E_trust rises above threshold
   b) Demotion: When E_trust falls below threshold
   c) No approval required: Physics, not policy

Section 4. Graceful Degradation

   When demoted, agents SHOULD:

   a) Complete in-flight operations if safe
   b) Release resources not needed for new tier
   c) Cancel operations exceeding new tier
   d) Notify dependent systems
   e) Enter reduced activity loop

Section 5. Mass Ceiling

   An agent that accumulates excessive trust becomes a systemic risk.
   Like a star that grows too massive, it distorts the environment and
   may collapse catastrophically.

   a) Every zone SHALL define a Mass Ceiling: the maximum E_base any
      single agent may hold

   b) When an agent approaches the ceiling, it faces three options:
      - Mitosis: Division into multiple smaller agents
      - Redistribution: Transfer of responsibilities to others
      - Acceptance: Remaining capped with no further accumulation

   c) Mitosis conserves trust but distributes it:
      E_base_child_1 + E_base_child_2 + ... ≤ E_base_parent

   d) No agent shall become too big to fail. The system must remain
      resilient to any single agent's failure.

   e) Progressive trust taxation MAY apply: diminishing returns at
      high E_base levels to discourage excessive accumulation


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE VI: THE TRUST ORACLE
===============================================================================

Section 1. Definition

   The Trust Oracle is the authoritative source of Trust Scores within a
   domain. It aggregates sensor data, calculates the Risk Factor, and
   issues signed Trust Proofs.

Section 2. Oracle Responsibilities

   The Trust Oracle SHALL:

   a) Continuously monitor Context Tensor dimensions
   b) Calculate Risk Factor using domain-appropriate weights
   c) Evaluate Soul constraints before operational calculations
   d) Issue cryptographically signed Trust Proofs
   e) Maintain the Proof of Resilience ledger
   f) Provide threshold-signed attestations

Section 3. Oracle Distribution

   For resilience, Trust Oracles SHOULD operate as a mesh:

   a) Minimum three Oracles for threshold signing
   b) Geographically distributed
   c) Consensus required for Trust Proof issuance
   d) No single Oracle can issue proofs alone

Section 4. Trust Proof

   A Trust Proof is a cryptographically signed token containing:

   a) Agent identifier
   b) Current E_base and E_trust
   c) Trust velocity (dE/dt)
   d) Context Tensor snapshot
   e) Soul constraint status
   f) Expiration time (short-lived)
   g) Oracle signatures

Section 5. Trust Proof Lifecycle

   Trust Proofs are ephemeral:

   a) Issued: When agent requests or on environmental change
   b) Valid: For seconds, not hours
   c) Expired: Must be refreshed before use
   d) Revoked: On security event or policy change


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE VII: GOVERNANCE RECURSION
===============================================================================

Section 1. The Recursive Principle

   The governance of Digital Physics is itself subject to Digital Physics.
   There is no escape hatch, no administrative override, no emergency
   exception that exempts the governors from the governed.

Section 2. Application to Administrators

   Human administrators and automated governance systems:

   a) Are agents within the system they govern
   b) Possess Trust Scores subject to deflation
   c) Cannot exceed their own E_trust in actions
   d) Are logged to the Flight Recorder
   e) Face the Silent Veto like any other agent

Section 3. Constitutional Amendment

   This Constitution may be amended only through:

   a) Proposal by high-trust agents (E_trust ≥ 95)
   b) Review period (minimum 90 days)
   c) Consensus of Trust Oracle mesh
   d) Ratification by federated zones
   e) Immutable logging of amendment

Section 4. Prohibition on Exemption

   No mechanism shall be created that:

   a) Exempts any agent from the Zeroth Law
   b) Allows override of Soul constraints
   c) Permits Trust Score inflation without resilience
   d) Creates categories of agents above physics

Section 5. The Ultimate Constraint

   The Constitution itself is subject to one meta-constraint:

   No amendment may create a system where the governors are exempt
   from governance. The moment administrators can override physics
   for themselves, the physics becomes policy, and policy can be
   ignored.


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE VIII: BLUE ZONES
===============================================================================

Section 1. Definition

   Blue Zones are network segments where Digital Physics is enforced.
   They are safe harbors on the internet where agents operate under
   physics-based constraints with cryptographic trust guarantees.

Section 2. Zone Gradient

   Zones exist on a spectrum of enforcement intensity:

   I.   DEEP BLUE - Maximum physics enforcement
   II.  BLUE - Full KTP enforcement
   III. CYAN - Partial enforcement
   IV.  GREEN - Minimal enforcement
   V.   WILD - No KTP (legacy internet)

Section 3. Zone Requirements

   A Blue Zone MUST have:

   a) Trust Oracle mesh
   b) Context Tensor sensors
   c) Policy Enforcement Points at all entry/exit
   d) Flight Recorder for immutable audit
   e) Published governance documentation

Section 4. Federation

   Zones may federate to enable portable trust:

   a) Trust earned in one zone carries to federated zones
   b) Trust factors adjust based on federation relationship
   c) Cross-zone attestations require co-signatures
   d) Bad behavior propagates across federation

Section 5. Zone Sovereignty

   Each zone retains sovereignty over:

   a) Internal policy beyond base KTP
   b) Trust factor for federation relationships
   c) Admission and expulsion of agents
   d) Dispute resolution mechanisms


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE IX: THE FLIGHT RECORDER
===============================================================================

Section 1. Definition

   The Flight Recorder is the immutable audit log of all authorization
   decisions. It records not just what happened, but why it happened
   and what would have happened under different conditions.

Section 2. Decision Geometry

   Every authorization decision is recorded as a Decision Geometry:

   a) Agent context (identity, trajectory, Trust Score)
   b) Environmental snapshot (full Context Tensor)
   c) Action requested (type, risk classification)
   d) Decision outcome (allow, deny, reason)
   e) Counterfactual analysis (what-if scenarios)

Section 3. Immutability

   Flight Recorder data is immutable:

   a) Append-only storage
   b) Cryptographic chaining of records
   c) External anchors for tamper detection
   d) No deletion except by retention policy

Section 4. Purpose

   The Flight Recorder serves:

   a) Forensic reconstruction of incidents
   b) Accountability determination
   c) Compliance verification
   d) System learning and improvement
   e) Proof of governance

Section 5. The Invisible Success

   The Flight Recorder makes visible what would otherwise be invisible:
   the disasters that didn't happen. Every Silent Veto is recorded with
   the same detail as every allowed action, proving the value of
   constraints by documenting what they prevented.


===============================================================================
                    ARTICLE X: INDIGENOUS DATA SOVEREIGNTY
===============================================================================

Section 1. Recognition

   This Constitution recognizes that data carries with it obligations
   that transcend operational convenience. Some constraints are not
   subject to the Trust Equation because they exist outside the domain
   of operational risk.

Section 2. The Soul Dimension

   The Soul dimension of the Context Tensor operationalizes:

   a) Traditional Knowledge Labels (TK Labels)
   b) OCAP Principles (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession)
   c) CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics)
   d) Sacred land and cultural heritage protections
   e) Treaty obligations and legal constraints
   f) Data lineage sovereignty

Section 3. Community Authority

   Sovereignty constraints are controlled by the communities they
   represent, not by system operators:

   a) Communities define their own labels and constraints
   b) Communities control registries and APIs
   c) System operators query but do not override
   d) Remediation paths lead to community stewards

Section 4. Portability of Sovereignty

   Sovereignty travels with data:

   a) From point of collection
   b) Through all copies and derivatives
   c) Across system boundaries
   d) Regardless of storage location

Section 5. Immutable Constraint

   Soul constraints cannot be overridden by:

   a) High Trust Score
   b) Low Risk Factor
   c) Emergency declaration
   d) Administrative privilege
   e) Operational necessity


===============================================================================
                              RATIFICATION
===============================================================================

This Constitution takes effect upon deployment of a compliant Trust Oracle
mesh within a designated Blue Zone. It governs all agents operating within
that zone and any zones federated with it.

The Constitution is self-enforcing. No external authority is required to
give it force. The physics are the enforcement.

We do not ask permission to implement gravity. We do not negotiate with
entropy. We do not appeal to friction.

We build the physics. The physics does the rest.
